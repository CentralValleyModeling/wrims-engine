# WRIMS Engine

This project is a Java application built with Gradle, designed for the Central Valley Modeling community. It provides tools and components for water resources modeling and simulation, supporting reproducible builds and easy integration with other Java-based systems.

Established as a core component of the WRIMS 3 (Water Resources Integrated Modeling System), this engine is intended to facilitate the development and execution of water resource models, particularly in the context of California's Central Valley.

## Key Features

- Java-based modeling engine
- Gradle build system for streamlined development and publishing
- Supports publishing artifacts to GitHub Packages (Maven repository)
- Environment variable validation for secure publishing
- Deploys wrims-core modules to the CentralValleyModeling GitHub Packages repository on tagged builds

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
