# Building WRIMS-ENGINE from Eclipse IDE
This document covers the configuration for building the WRIMS-ENGINE project from the Eclipse IDE using Gradle.

NOTE: The current WRIMS-ENGINE build is built on Java 21.
The recommended version of Eclipse uses Java 21 by default.
Setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK 21 installation directory is recommended, but not required to build the project from Eclipse.

If you need to keep you JAVA_HOME set to java 1.8 for other projects you can manually run the gradle build by explicitly calling the java executable from the command line as described below.

# WRIMS-ENGINE Developer Build Setup - Using Gradle:
PREREQUISITES:
- Git
    - https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
- \<USER-DIR\>\\.gradle\gradle.properties configured with token for access to the CentralValleyModeling GitHub repository
    - Example: C:\\Users\\\<username\>\\.gradle\gradle.properties
    - NOTE: If you have to create the gradle.properties file, make sure it's not a "gradle.properties.txt" file.
```
...
cvmUserId=<githubUserId>
cvmPassword=<githubPersonalAccessToken>
...
```
The cvmPassword is preferably set to a GitHub personal access token that has been granted access to
the CentralValleyModeling GitHub repository with public_repo access and read:packages enabled.<br>

You can generate a personal access token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
    
- Java JDK 21 installed (https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=21)
  - NOTE: Any flavor of JDK 21 should work if you already have one installed. 

- IDE Eclipse
      - Latest Eclipse RCP download site:
      - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2024-12/r/eclipse-ide-rcp-and-rap-developers

> [!WARNING]
> If you don't set the cvmUserId and cvmPassword in your gradle.properties file, you will get errors
> when you load the project into Eclipse. If that happens, you'll need to set the missing parameters in your gradle.properties file.
> Then remove and re-import the project to eclipse to clear the errors and load correctly.<br>
> Make sure your gradle.properties file is in the correct location under your user directory and not a .txt file.<br>
> <br>
> Never add your github username/token to any properties within project source code or it risks
> being committed & exposed to the public.

## 1. Pull Source from GitHub & build the project
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
    - Repository Clone URL: https://github.com/CentralValleyModeling/wrims-engine.git
- CD into the wrims-engine directory.
- Build the project with gradle from the command line

The following commands will clone the repository, and build the project from a command prompt.
Alternatively, you can use your preferred git repo manager tool to clone the wrims repo and checkout the wrims-devops branch.
```
git clone https://github.com/CentralValleyModeling/wrims-engine.git
cd wrims-engine
gradlew build
```

### Common Build Errors
If you don't have the JAVA_HOME environment variable set to a JDK 21 installation directory, you may get errors like this:

```cmd
C:\GitHub\CVM2\wrims-engine>gradlew build

ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.

Please set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the
location of your Java installation.
```
Or if you have an older version of Java installed under you JAVA_HOME environment variable, you would see a similar java version error.
In this case you can either set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK 21 installation directory, or you can directly call the java executable from the command line like this:

/path/to/your/jdk/bin/java -jar gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar build

```cmd example
C:\GitHub\CVM2\wrims-engine>C:\java\jdk-21.0.8.9-hotspot\bin\java -jar gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar build
Starting a Gradle Daemon, 5 incompatible Daemons could not be reused, use --status for details

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 29s

## 2. Open Eclipse with a new/clean workspace

Once you have built the wrims-engine project with Gradle from the command line, you can open Eclipse with a new workspace to import the project.
Using Eclipse 2024-12, the default Java version is 21, so you should not need to change the Java version in Eclipse.

## 3. Import the wrims-engine project into Eclipse
Close the "Welcome" window if it appears.
Click File-> Import... and select Import as an Existing Gradle Project

Select the wrims-engine project directory and click next.

Complete the import with default settings.

Click Finish to import.

Once the build is complete, you should see 0 errors in the Problems window.</br>
Gradle Tasks & Gradle Executions windows default to the bottom of the Eclipse window.

## 4. Build wrims-engine with Gradle task
From the "Gradle Tasks" window, run the "build" task on the root project.
